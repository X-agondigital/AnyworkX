          <br>
          <br>
          <b>Information we receive from others:</b> In addition to the information you may provide us directly, we receive information about you from others, including:
        </p>
        <p><b>Other Users:</b> Other users may provide information about you as they use our services, for instance as they interact with you or if they submit a report involving you.</p>
        <p><b>Social media:</b> You are required to share information with us about your social media account as part of our verification process. We may also share information with us about your social media account if you decide to create and log in to your AnyworkX account via your social media or other account (e.g. Facebook, Google or Apple), or to upload onto our services information such as photos from any of your social media accounts (e.g. Instagram or Spotify).</p>
        <p><b>Affiliates:</b> AnyworkX considers the safety and security of its users a top priority. If you were banned from any service X-agon Digital Solutions Limited has affiliation with, your information can be shared with us to allow us to take necessary actions, including closing your account or preventing you from creating an account on our services.</p>
        <p><b>Other partners:</b> We may receive information about you from our strategic partners, which include law enforcement agencies, the judiciary, human right groups, media publications, or where our ads are published on a partner’s service (in which case they may pass along details on a campaign’s success). Where legally allowed, we can also receive information about suspected or convicted bad actors from third parties, as part of our efforts to ensure our users’ safety and security.</p>
        <p><b>Information generated or automatically collected when you use our services:</b> When you use our services, this generates technical data about which features you have used, how you have used them and the devices you use to access our services. See below for more details.</p>
        <p><b>Usage information:</b> Using the services of AnyworkX generates data about your activity on our App, for instance how you use them (e.g. when you logged in, features you have been using, actions taken, information shown to you, referring webpages address and ads that you interacted with) and your interactions with other users (e.g. users you connect and interact with, and when you connected and exchanged messages with them).</p>
        <p><b>Device information:</b> We collect information from and about the device(s) you use to access our services, including hardware and software information such as IP address, device ID and type, app settings and characteristics, app crashes, advertising IDs (which are randomly generated numbers that you can reset by going into your device settings and, in some cases, disable entirely), and identifiers associated with cookies or other technologies that may uniquely identify a device or browser.</p>
        <p><b>Information collected by cookies and similar technologies:</b> We use and may allow others to use cookies and similar technologies (e.g. web beacons, pixels, SDKs) to recognise you and/or your device(s). You may read our Cookie Policy for more information on why we use them and how you can better control their use.</p>
        <p>Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome) have a 'Do Not Track' ('DNT') feature which tells a website that a user does not want to have their online activity tracked. If a website that responds to a DNT signal receives a DNT signal, the browser can block that website from collecting certain information about the browser’s user. Not all browsers offer a DNT option and DNT signals are not yet uniform. For this reason, many businesses, including ours, do not currently respond to DNT signals.</p>
        <p><b>Other information with your consent:</b> Precise geolocation data: If you give us your consent, we can collect your precise geolocation (latitude and longitude) from your device. The collection of your geolocation may occur in the background even when you aren’t using the services if the permission you gave us expressly permits such collection. If you decline permission for us to collect your precise geolocation, we will not collect it, and those of our services which rely on precise geolocation may not be available to you.</p>
        <p><b>Photo verification data:</b> The safety and security of users are very important to us. This is achieved in part through our photo verification feature. If you choose to participate in our photo verification feature, we collect your face geometry data, which may be considered biometric data in some jurisdictions, to verify that you are the real you. You can learn more about photo verification and how we process your face geometry data.</p>
        <p><b>Other information:</b> We may collect other information with your permission, such as photos and videos (for instance, if you want to publish a photo or video or participate in streaming features on our services).</p>

        <div class="privacy-container">
          <p>
            <span>Provide our service to you:</span> The reason we process your
            information for purposes A, B and C above is to perform the contract
            that you have with us. For instance, as you go about using our
            service to make meaningful connections on your service and business
            needs, we use your information to maintain your account and your
            profile, make it viewable to other users and recommend other users

            help keep our users safe, and we process data where necessary to
            enforce our rights, assist law enforcement and enable us to defend

            accounting, tax, and other statutory data retention obligations and
            to be able to respond to valid access requests from law enforcement.

            they may have taken to opt out of a given feature or processing.

            geolocation) or by deleting your content (for instance where you

        <h2>6. How we share information</h2>
        <p>
          Since our goal is to help you make seamless connection for your
          business and service needs, the major aspect of sharing of users’
          information is, of course, with other users. We also share some types
          of user information with external service providers and partners who
          assist us in operating the services, with other X-agon Digital
          Solutions Ltd for specified reasons as laid out below and, in some
          cases, legal authorities. Read on for more details about how your
          information is shared with others.
        </p>

        <h4>With other users</h4>

        </p>

        <p>
          If you choose to limit the audience for all or part of your profile,
          or for certain content or information about you, then it will be
          visible according to your settings.
        </p>

        <p>
          If someone submits a report involving you (such as a claim that you
          violated our Terms of Use), we may communicate to the reporter
          actions, if any, we took as a result of their report.
        </p>

        <h4>With our service providers and partners</h4>

        <p>
          We use vendors to help us operate, distribute, market, and improve our
          services, such as data hosting and maintenance, analytics, customer
          care, marketing, advertising, payment processing and security
          operations. We also share information with vendors who distribute and
          assist us in advertising our services. For instance, we may share
          limited information on you in hashed, non-human readable form to
          advertising vendors.
        </p>

        <p>
          We follow a strict vetting process prior to engaging any vendor or
          working with any partner. Our vendors and partners must agree to
          strict confidentiality obligations.
        </p>

            other wrongdoings
          </li>
          <li>
            We may also share information with other companies under X-agon

            functionality.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>For corporate transactions</h4>

        <p>
          We may transfer your information if we are involved, whether in whole
          or in part, in a merger, sale, acquisition, divestiture,
          restructuring, reorganisation, dissolution, bankruptcy or other change
          of ownership or control.
        </p>

        <h4>With law enforcement/when required by law</h4>

        <p>
          We may disclose your information if reasonably necessary: (i) to

          warrant, government/law enforcement investigation or other legal
          requirements; (ii) to assist in the prevention or detection of crime
          (subject in each case to applicable law); or (iii) to protect the
          safety of any person.
        </p>

        <h4>To enforce legal rights</h4>

        <p>
          We may also share information: (i) if disclosure would mitigate our
          liability in an actual or threatened lawsuit; (ii) as necessary to
          protect our legal rights and the legal rights of our users, business
          partners or other interested parties; (iii) to enforce our agreements
          with you; and (iv) to investigate, prevent or take other action
          regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud, or other wrongdoing.
        </p>

        <h4>With your consent or at your request</h4>

        <p>
          We may ask for your consent to share your information with third
          parties. In any such case, we will make it clear why we want to share
          the information.
        </p>

        <p>
          We may use and share non-personal information (meaning information
          that, by itself, does not identify who you are such as device
          information, general demographics, general behavioural data, location
          in de-identified form), as well as personal information in hashed,
          non-human readable form, under any of the above circumstances. We may
          also share this information with other businesses under X-agon Digital
          Solutions Limited and third parties (notably advertisers) to develop
          and deliver targeted advertising on our services and on websites or
          applications of third parties, and to analyse and report on
          advertising you see. We may combine this information with additional
          non-personal information or personal information in hashed, non-human
          readable form collected from other sources. More information on our

        <h2>7. Cross-border data transfers</h2>

        <p>
          Sharing of information laid out in Section 5 involves cross-border
          data transfers to other jurisdictions that may have different laws
          about data processing. When we transfer personal information outside
          of Nigeria, we use standard contract clauses (standard contractual
          clauses are commitments between companies transferring personal data,
          binding them to protect the privacy and security of your data) or
          other appropriate transfer mechanism.

        <h2>8. Your rights and choices</h2>

        <p>
          We want you to be in control of your information, so we want to remind
          you of the following options and tools available to you:
        </p>

        <p>
          <span>Access/update tools in the service:</span> Tools and account
          settings can help you access, rectify or remove information that you
          provided to us and that is associated with your account directly
          within the service. If you have any questions on those tools and
          settings, please contact our customer care team for help.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span>Device permissions:</span> Mobile platforms can have permission
          systems for specific types of device data and notifications, such as
          phone contacts, pictures, location services, push notifications and
          advertising identifiers. You can change your settings on your device
          to either consent or oppose the collection or processing of the
          corresponding information or the display of the corresponding
          notifications. Of course, if you do that, certain services may lose
          functionality and you may not be able to use the App maximally.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span>Uninstall:</span> You can stop all information collection by an
          app by uninstalling it using the standard uninstall process for your
          device. Reuser that uninstalling an app does NOT close your account.
          To close your account, please use the corresponding functionality on
          the service.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span>Account closure:</span> You can close your account by using the
          corresponding functionality directly on the service.
        </p>

        <p>
          We also want you to be aware of your privacy rights. Depending on
          where you live, you may have the right to:
        </p>

        <p>
          <span>Access/know:</span> You may have the right to request a copy of
          the information we keep about you, and in certain circumstances to
          receive this in a portable format. You can exercise your right to
          access directly within the service by putting in a request.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span>Delete/erase:</span> You may request that we delete the personal
          information we keep about you. You can exercise your right to delete
          by submitting a request.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span>Correct/rectify/update:</span> You can correct most information
          you provided to us by editing your profile directly in the service. If
          you believe the information that we hold about you is inaccurate, you

        </p>

        <p>
          <span>Object/restrict:</span> You may also have the right to object to
          or request that we restrict certain processing. To do so, please
          contact us.
        </p>

        <p>
          For your protection and the protection of all of our users, we may ask
          you to provide proof of identity before we can answer the above
          requests. Keep in mind, we may reject requests, including if we are
          unable to authenticate you, if the request is unlawful or invalid, or
          if it may infringe on trade secrets or intellectual property or the
          privacy or other rights of someone else. If you wish to receive
          information relating to another user, such as a copy of any messages
          you received from them through our service, the other user will have
          to contact us to provide their written consent before the information
          is released. We may also ask them to provide proof of identity before
          we can answer the request. We may also not be able to accommodate
          certain requests to object to or restrict the processing of personal
          information, notably where such requests would not allow us to provide
          our service to you anymore. For instance, we cannot provide our
          service if we do not have your date of birth and, thus, cannot ensure
          that you are 18 years of age or older.
        </p>

        <p>
          You have a right to lodge a complaint with the appropriate data
          protection authority if you have concerns about how we process your
          personal information. There are data protection regulators in many
          jurisdictions. The data protection authority you can lodge a complaint
          with may be that of your habitual residence, where you work or where
          an alleged infringement took place.

        <h2>9. How long we retain your information</h2>

        <p>
          We keep your personal information only as long as we need it for
          legitimate business purposes (as laid out in Section 4) and as
          permitted by applicable law. If you decide to stop using our services,
          you can close your account and your profile will stop being visible to
          other users. Note that we will close your account automatically if you
          are inactive for a period of two years. After your account is closed,
          we will delete your personal information, as laid out below:
        </p>

        <p>
          To protect the safety and security of our users, we implement a safety
          retention window of three months following account closure, or one
          year following an account ban. During this period, we keep your
          information in the event that it might be necessary to investigate
          unlawful or harmful conducts. The retention of information during this
          safety retention window is based on our legitimate interest, as well
          as that of potential third-party victims.
        </p>

        <p>
          Once the safety retention window elapses, we delete your data and only
          keep limited information for specified purposes, as laid out below:
        </p>

        <p>
          a. We maintain limited data to comply with legal data retention
          obligations: in particular, we keep transaction data for 10 years to
          comply with tax and accounting legal requirements, credit card
          information for the duration the user may challenge the transaction
          and “traffic data”/logs for one year to comply with legal data
          retention obligations. We also keep records of consents users give us
          for five years to evidence our compliance with applicable law.
        </p>

        <p>
          b. We maintain limited information on the basis of our legitimate
          interest: we keep customer care records and supporting data as well as
          imprecise location of download/purchase for five years to support our
          customer care decisions, enforce our rights and enable us to defend
          ourselves in the event of a claim, information on the existence of
          past accounts and subscriptions, which we delete three years after the
          closure of your last account to ensure proper and accurate financial
          forecasting and reporting, profile data for one year in anticipation
          of potential litigation, for the establishment, exercise or defence of
          legal claims, and data necessary to prevent users who were banned from
          opening a new account, for as long as necessary to ensure the safety
          and vital interests of our users.
        </p>

        <p>
          c. Finally, we maintain information on the basis of our legitimate
          interest where there is an outstanding or potential issue, claim or
          dispute requiring us to keep information (in particular if we receive
          a valid legal subpoena or request asking us to preserve data (in which
          case we would need to keep the data to comply with our legal
          obligations) or if data would otherwise be necessary as part of legal
          proceedings).

          contractors, and vendor representatives, as part of our recruitment
          and talent management operations and our management of the services
          that contractors and vendors provide to us. If you are a job
          candidate, contractor or vendor representative of ours, certain
          relevant terms of this Privacy Policy apply to our processing of your

        <p>
          If you are a job applicant, the personal information we process about

          what you provide to us as part of your job application, as well as
          professional qualifications, background, and reference information
          that recruiters or other third parties share with us. We use this
          information to support the recruitment process, which may lead to an
          employment contract. For contractors and vendor representatives, we

          as necessary to manage our relationship with you and your employer,
          which is necessary for the performance of the services agreement, and
          to establish, exercise or defend potential legal claims. We may share
          personal information with service providers that assist us with
          recruitment and technical data processing operations, as well as with
          Match Group companies (for instance, if you have a business

          information only as long as is necessary for those purposes.
