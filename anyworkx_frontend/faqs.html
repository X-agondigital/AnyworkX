          <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>
              AnyworkX is a huge online marketplace where vendors of legitimate
              services can showcase their business and display their competence
              through their profile and experience to prospective customers who
              may need those services anywhere and at any time. There are
              different categories of service providers on the App. AnyworkX is
              being positioned to be the biggest marketplace for services.

          <button class="accordion">What are the benefits of the App?</button>
          <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>
              The benefits are just too many. AnyworkX brings convenience and
              safety to both service providers and their customers. As a service
              provider, AnyworkX exposes you to so many customers, much more
              than any social media account can. That means more money in your
              pocket. As a customer, just within the comfort of your location
              you have access to so many service providers. Even in periods of
              emergency, assistance is just a few clicks away. AnyworkX has got
              users covered.

        <div class="service-list">
          <button class="accordion">How does it work?</button>
          <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>
              It is simple. AnyworkX connects service providers to potential
              clients. The vendor registers on the App by downloading it from
              the Playstore; chooses the category of service s/he is into, fills
              in necessary details and uploads the images of his/her services
              for display on the wall of the App for the millions of the App
              users to see across the country. The vendor has the option on the
              App to enable or disable his/her availability to render service.
              The customers will also download the App and register. When in
              need of a service provider, the customer will go on the App,
              select the service category, and see service providers for that
              category who have enabled their availability. Potential customers
              can shop online real-time for service providers, and they can
              decide the maximum distance of the search. It’s much more fun and
              freedom than you can imagine. Just download the AnyworkX and
              explore the endless possibilities.

            <p>
              A vendor is anyone who has a legitimate service to render and is
              registered under a particular category of service on the AnyworkX
              App. All our vendors have their profile displayed on their walls
              for easy viewing and ordering by potential customers nationwide.

              YES. It is possible for the vendors to change from one category of
              service to another. We however do not allow multiple registration

              A service provider can list just one category of service. You can

              AnyworkX is free. However, to ensure the safety and security of
              users of the App, it is mandatory that both service providers and
              customers pass through different stages of verification of their
              identity before they can transact business through the App. The
              verification cost just a token. We want to ensure that everyone is
              safe when using the App.

            <p>
              A customer can only cancel an order before the service provider is
              dispatched. After it is dispatched, the process has already been
              initiated and costs incurred. If the buyer insists, surcharge can
              be up to 100% of the call out fee.

              stages of identity verification. So the probability of fraudulent
              transaction is significantly reduced. AnyworkX is all about
              customer’s confidence. Also, a customer can track the movement of
              the vendor to where the service is needed. You only need to try

              By completing all levels of verification, a user becomes a top

              many more people during a search while a top profile customer
