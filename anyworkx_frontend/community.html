      <h1>AnyworkX Community Guidelines</h1>

      <article>
        <p>
          AnyworkX is a marketplace for services. We expect service transactions
          to be consummated honestly. It’s a platform where service providers
          and customers have to be real about who they are, what they are
          trained/licensed to do and what they are looking for.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our primary objective is to provide a platform that ensures the safety
          and security of users. We want to create a seamless business
          opportunity for service providers and seamless search for service
          providers by customers. We want users of AnyworkX App to have maximum
          satisfaction, and to use our platform safely and responsibly. All our
          stakeholders across Africa rely on us to maintain a secure and
          trustworthy platform to transact service business. We have created the
          AnyworkX Clan, which would be a unique pan African clan. We have also
          established guidelines to members of the Clan to provide them with
          information about what is acceptable and what is not acceptable
          behaviour on AnyworkX.
        </p>

        <p>
          These guidelines have been developed through consultations with
          stakeholders and learning points from day-to-day business activities
          and the commitment of our staff to maintain a safe and secure platform
          to transact business.
        </p>

        <p>
          We are committed to reviewing these guidelines regularly so that they
          capture issues that we encounter through the use of the App and
          accurately reflect and represent the diversity of members of the Clan
          while staying up to date with the many changes in the world.
        </p>

        <p>AnyworkX is not a place for:</p>

        <div>
          <p>
            <span>Minors:</span> AnyworkX is an adult only platform. This means
            that you must be 18 or older to join the platform. If we find any
            evidence that you might be underage, we will block you from the
            service. If we have done so mistakenly, we reserve the right to ask
            for identification to verify your age.
          </p>

          <p>
            We understand that some members would like to include children in
            their pictures. We ask that children do not appear alone in the
            images and be completely clothed. This is safer for everyone
            involved.
          </p>
          <p>In summary:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>No members under the age of 18.</li>
            <li>No photos of children alone in your profile.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>
            <span>Fake Profiles:</span> When you join AnyworkX, we expect you to
            represent yourself honestly. That means you must: use the name you
            go by in everyday life, we do not accept business names, only use
            real photos of yourself, not misrepresent yourself or impersonate
            anyone else, or alter any information about yourself.
          </p>

          <p>This includes:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Lying about your information including your age and location.
            </li>
            <li>Posting or sending photos that are not you.</li>
            <li>
              Posting or sending photoshopped pictures that would suggest you
              are someone else.
            </li>
            <li>Posting images where your face is obscured.</li>
            <li>
              Posting images with watermarks, logos, overlaying text or heavy
              editing.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>
            <span>Discrimination:</span> AnyworkX is a very diverse clan. This
            means members are expected to always respect other people’s beliefs,
            interests, and identity. AnyworkX takes a strong exception to hate
            speech and discrimination.
          </p>

          <p>
            We consider content to be hate speech (and take more severe actions
            against a profile) if it promotes or condones racism, bigotry,
            violence, hate, terrorism, dehumanisation, or harm against
            individuals or groups based on:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Race</li>
            <li>Ethnicity</li>
            <li>Disability</li>
            <li>Age</li>
            <li>Nationality</li>
            <li>Sexual orientation</li>
            <li>Gender</li>
            <li>Gender identity</li>
            <li>Religion</li>
            <li>Appearance (including body shaming)</li>
          </ul>

          <p>This includes:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Symbols representing hate groups or discriminatory beliefs.</li>
            <li>
              Jokes or memes that can be found to be hurtful or insensitive.
            </li>
            <li>
              Comments hoping or calling for harm on a person or group of
              people.
            </li>
            <li>
              Threats against any person or group, including political figures.
            </li>
            <li>Images that depict others as less than human.</li>
            <li>
              Forcing your opinion of an ideal identity onto another person. For
              instance, we take a strong stance against body shaming, or forcing
              your opinion of a ‘good body’ onto others.
            </li>
            <li>Harassment, Assault or Abuse</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            On AnyworkX, while we want you to express yourself with a potential
            customer or service provider, you should not do so in a way that
            might make them feel uncomfortable or targeted.
          </p>

          <p>This includes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Stalking both online and in person</li>
            <li>Unsolicited Lewd Imagery</li>
            <li>Unwanted sexual advances and/or comments</li>
            <li>Non-consensual intimate images or videos</li>
            <li>Online sexual exploitation</li>
            <li>Sex trafficking</li>
            <li>Sexual Assault</li>
            <li>Child Sexual Exploitation and Abuse</li>
            <li>Threats or acts of violence</li>
            <li>Scams, Fraud</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Do not scam AnyworkX members or deceive members in any way for
            financial benefit. All transactions consummated via AnyworkX must be
            paid for through the AnyworkX App wallet.
          </p>
          <p>This means:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Sharing your financial account information for the purposes of
              receiving money from another member is prohibited.
            </li>
            <li>
              Trying to obtain highly personal information such as bank account
              information or a Bank Verification Number of National Identity
              Number is prohibited.
            </li>
            <li>
              Presenting the opportunity to receive something in return for
              money or information sent is prohibited.
            </li>
            <li>
              Faking business transaction intentions, financial and/or personal
              distress in order to get money from another member is prohibited.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            We do not permit content aimed to drive traffic or attention from an
            interaction on AnyworkX to external websites, accounts, products
            and/or services.
          </p>

          <p>
